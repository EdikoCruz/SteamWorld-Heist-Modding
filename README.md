Mods for SteamWorld Heist

## Introduction

This repository contains two projects: [A mod that I am doing for myself](MyDesign) and [A collection of mods extracted for other players that might like to use](Mods). I am testing with the [GoG](https://www.gog.com/game/steamworld_heist) alternative (version 2.1) in Linux and Windows.

For the mods to the community, I will provide translation to English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Also, I will do a translation to Portuguese (BR) for the base game and its DLCs.

For more information, check out each project.

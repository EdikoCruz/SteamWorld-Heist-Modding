# SWHModding

A mod collection for SteamWorld Heist.

I am testing mods with the GoG 2.1 version and providing translation to English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Caution! Before using the mods, create a backup of the save game. The game will add the mod to the save game, likewise any DLC, and you will not be able to use them without the modding.

# Cheating

mod01 - Unlock all hats from the base game
mod02 - Unlock all hats from the Outsider DLC
mod03 - Remove failure penalty from all difficulties levels

# Custom difficulty

mod03 - Remove failure penalty from all difficulties levels

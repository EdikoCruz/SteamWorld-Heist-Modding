# SteamWorld Heist Modding

## About the Project

I created this project to have fun and play as a game designer. Because of that, It will have a **slow** pace of development, and I will try to make the mods blend into the game like a DLC will do. Another goal of this project is to provide something to the community, so when I finish some mods and the pt-BR translation, I will spread it in the Steam and GoG forums.

Realistically, those who use mods want something that might never be in a DLC because it could not change core mechanics and hide them from new players, putting the designing processing in an odd spot. So, the mods must be well integrated into the game and designed for second rums.

## About the Mods

I am planning to create the scripts for the development only, so the mods will be as easy to install as copy and paste into the DLC folder.

I will provide translation to English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese (BR).
